# Professional Boundaries Training Module Plan (CMDHD Six-County Region)

High-Level Plan
•	Audience & Context: We will conduct a 1-hour training at Central Michigan District Health Department’s regional training day, with staff from six counties (Arenac, Clare, Gladwin, Isabella, Osceola, Roscommon) in attendance. All six counties are predominantly rural communities[1], and the training will be tailored to address the unique local factors of each county. We’ll leverage the CMDHD Professional Boundaries Policy (effective June 30, 2025) as our foundation, while making the content directly relevant to local realities (e.g. small-town environments, resource limitations, and cultural considerations in the region).
•	Objectives: By the end of the session, participants should understand the core principles of professional boundaries as defined by policy and learn how to adapt these boundaries to local factors in their county. This includes recognizing what professional boundaries are (expectations that “set a clear relationship between the client and staff, preventing role confusion”), knowing the do’s and don’ts from the policy (e.g. scope of practice limits, social media rules, gift policy), and developing strategies to handle common boundary challenges that arise due to our region’s demographics and community characteristics.
•	Content Overview: The training will combine quantitative data and qualitative scenarios to be comprehensive. We’ll start with a quick overview of the Professional Boundaries Policy to ground everyone in the rules and ethical standards. Then, we’ll present local data (e.g. population, income, health access stats) from each of the six counties to illustrate the environment our staff operate in – for instance, noting that counties like Clare and Gladwin have significantly high poverty rates and low median incomes (Clare’s median household income is only ~$37k vs. Michigan’s ~$55k)[2], and over 40% of residents live below 200% of the poverty line in multiple counties[3][4]. We’ll highlight that five of the six counties have an older-than-average population (20–31% of residents are seniors, compared to 16% statewide)[5][6] and face severe healthcare provider shortages (e.g. several counties have no local OB/GYN or psychiatric providers and extremely high patient-to-provider ratios)[7][8]. These factors help explain why boundary challenges (like dual relationships or requests for extra help) are common in our service area.
•	Teaching Methods: We will use a mix of lecture, group discussion, and scenario-based learning. Important points from the policy will be introduced in a clear, summarized form (ensuring everyone knows the rules). Then, to keep it engaging and relevant, we’ll introduce realistic scenarios that staff might encounter in our counties (e.g. a client asking for a ride in a rural area with no transportation – a direct test of boundaries about staying in scope). Attendees will break into small groups or participate in whole-room discussion to talk through how to handle each scenario. We’ll guide these discussions to connect back to policy guidelines and to share best practices. This interactive approach lets staff apply the concepts to real-life local situations (qualitative context), reinforcing their understanding.
•	Customization for Counties: Because we have representatives from each of the six counties, we will make the training even more relevant by referencing each county’s context where possible. For example, we might mention: “In Roscommon County, where nearly 1 in 3 residents is over 65[5], you may find clients treat you almost like family – but remember, social relationships with clients are inappropriate per our policy. Let’s talk about how to politely maintain a caring professional relationship without crossing into friendship.” Likewise, for Isabella County (with a college-town population and the Saginaw Chippewa tribal community), we’ll discuss scenarios like younger clients connecting on social media or cultural/community events that staff might be invited to – and how to maintain boundaries respectfully in those cases. By weaving in these county-specific elements, staff will see that we acknowledge their local challenges and culture, making the training more engaging and applicable.
•	Key Topics to Cover: (1) Definition and Importance of Professional Boundaries – why boundaries matter for ethical, effective service (to protect clients and staff, ensure fairness, and prevent “role confusion”). (2) CMDHD Policy Highlights – concrete rules: setting expectations, scope of practice limits, avoiding conflicts of interest, handling dual relationships, confidentiality, no out-of-work contact, and gift acceptance rules[9]. (3) Local Factors Affecting Boundaries – how rural small-community life, limited resources, and local demographics can pressure staff to blur boundaries (with data support). (4) Adaptive Strategies and Scenarios – how to uphold the policy in tough situations common to our area, through examples and group problem-solving. (5) Resources & Support – reminding staff of supervisor support, reporting channels, and the policy document itself as ongoing references if they face a boundary dilemma.
•	Outcome: The training will provide a scaffolded understanding – starting from principles and rules, adding context, then practicing application. Staff will leave with a clear understanding of professional boundaries and feel more confident in navigating boundary challenges specific to their communities. They’ll also be aware that while the policy is uniform, its application can be nuanced by local context – and they’ll have practical techniques (both qualitative insights from shared experiences and quantitative awareness of community needs) to adjust their professional boundaries without violating policy. This prepares them to deliver services ethically across all six counties, strengthening professional conduct region-wide.
Detailed Step-by-Step Instructions
Below is a step-by-step breakdown of the 60-minute training module, including content and activities to be covered, roughly in order:
1.	Introduction (5 minutes) – Set the stage for the training.
2.	Welcome & Purpose: Introduce ourselves (trainers) and state that the session will focus on maintaining professional boundaries while working in our six-county region. Explain why this topic is crucial: it ensures we provide quality care while protecting both client and staff. Emphasize that CMDHD has an official Professional Boundaries Policy that guides our behavior, and this training will help everyone understand and apply it.
3.	Define “Professional Boundaries”: Provide a clear definition so everyone is on the same page. For instance, “Professional boundaries are the expectations that set a clear relationship between client and staff, preventing role confusion”. In simple terms, this means knowing the limits of our role and maintaining a helpful, but professional relationship (not a personal one) with clients.
4.	Outline Objectives: Quickly outline the session’s goals: “We’ll review our policy, look at the unique challenges in our communities, and practice handling tricky situations. By the end, you should know not just the rules, but how to adjust your approach in a small community or resource-limited setting while still following those rules.” This primes participants for what’s ahead.
5.	Review of CMDHD Professional Boundaries Policy (10 minutes) – Highlight key policy points and ensure baseline knowledge.
6.	Distribute or project a summary of the policy. Rather than reading it word-for-word, summarize the critical rules in an easily digestible format (bullet points or a slide). Cover these key elements from the policy, explaining each with examples:
o	Setting expectations with clients: Staff should set clear expectations at the start of services – explain what the staff can and cannot do for the client. For example, a home visiting nurse might say on the first visit, “I’m here to provide health education and support, but I can’t run errands or provide transportation.” Setting this boundary early helps prevent misunderstandings.
o	Scope of practice: Staff must work only within their professional role/scope and refer clients out as needed. We do not perform tasks outside our job duties – no transporting clients in our personal cars, no running personal errands for clients, or other favors outside of our healthcare role. Tie this to examples: even if a client has no family to get groceries, a staff member should connect them with a volunteer service or food pantry, rather than personally shopping for them, because doing so blurs professional lines.
o	Ethical standards and conflicts of interest: Staff must follow their profession’s ethics and be alert to conflicts of interest. Explain a conflict of interest in plain terms: any situation where personal interests or relationships might interfere with professional judgment. The policy says to inform the client when a real/potential conflict arises and make the client’s interests primary, even if that means transferring care to someone else. Example: if you realize you’re related to or close friends with a client, that’s a potential conflict – which leads to the next point.
o	Pre-existing personal relationships: If a staff member already knows a client socially (or becomes related/close), they must discuss it with their supervisor and decide how to proceed. Maybe the client should be reassigned to another worker to keep things professional. This includes relationships like family, friends, neighbors, or any romantic/business ties. We emphasize: Don’t just ignore it – report it so we can handle it ethically.
o	No social relationships or social media contact: According to policy, staff should not have social relationships with current clients and online/social media contact is prohibited. This means no “friending” or following clients on Facebook, Instagram, etc. while they’re under our care. Even if you get a friend request from a client, the rule is you “may not knowingly friend an individual currently receiving services from CMDHD”* without supervisory approval. Explain the rationale: interacting on social media can blur personal/professional lines and risk privacy. If clients want updates or to communicate, it should be through official channels, not our personal profiles.
o	Professional communication and conduct: All interactions with clients should use clear, respectful, and professional language[10]. Even if you’re friendly, maintain that professional tone – no inappropriate language or over-sharing of your own personal life. Also, avoid controversial topics like politics or religion with clients[11] which could damage the professional relationship.
o	Time boundaries: Staff should not conduct services outside of work hours (unless pre-approved by a supervisor)[12]. This reminds us not to unofficially visit or help clients on personal time – e.g. don’t drop by a client’s home on a weekend to check on them; that crosses from professional to personal territory. We operate during work hours so interactions remain professional and accountable.
o	Gifts and favors: The policy clearly prohibits accepting gifts or favors from clients (or giving gifts to clients) beyond nominal tokens[9]. We cannot accept money, expensive items, or big favors – this could be seen as a conflict or undue influence. Small tokens (under $25) of appreciation or “normal business courtesies” (like a client baking cookies for the whole office during holidays) may be okay[9], but when in doubt, politely decline or check with a supervisor. Emphasize: “When a grateful client offers you something, it’s best to thank them and kindly explain that our policies don’t allow us to accept gifts. Instead, you can suggest a thank-you card or feedback letter if they want to show appreciation.”*
7.	Throughout this review, invite quick questions for clarification. Ensure everyone internalizes that these rules are not abstract – they apply to daily work interactions. Reinforce that following these keeps our relationships professional and ethical, which ultimately protects clients (no favoritism, no exploitation) and protects staff (legally and professionally).
8.	Local Context: Six-County Factors (10 minutes) – Present data and examples to connect boundaries with local realities.
9.	Transition by saying: “Now let’s talk about our service area – the communities YOU work in – and why maintaining boundaries here might have some special challenges.” Use a few slides or a handout with key statistics for each county to give a snapshot. For brevity, you might group some stats or highlight notable contrasts:
o	Population & Rural Nature: Show that our health district covers a combined population of ~191,000 spread across six counties[1], with most counties being rural and sparsely populated. Only Isabella County has a relatively bigger population (~70k) with a small city (Mount Pleasant) and a university, while the others range from ~15k to 30k each. All six counties are officially classified as “rural” by the state[13][14]. This rural character means people often live in small towns or out in the country, and staff and clients may frequently encounter each other in the community (the classic “everyone knows everyone” situation).
o	Age and Demographics: Point out the age distribution – e.g. “Our counties have an older population compared to Michigan overall.” Give examples: Roscommon County’s seniors (65+) make up 31% of its population – nearly double the U.S. average[5]. Gladwin and Arenac have about 24–26% seniors[6][15], well above the state’s ~16%. Only Isabella is younger (due to college students, only ~12% seniors)[16]. This matters because serving older adults can blur lines – clients might see staff as friends or even family-like figures if they lack social support. We should be caring, but we still must keep it professional (e.g. not becoming a client’s “personal friend” out of pity).
o	Also mention disability rates: many of our counties have high rates of people living with disabilities (e.g. 26% in Roscommon, 23% in Clare[17][18], versus ~14% statewide). Clients with disabilities or chronic health issues may need a lot of assistance, which can tug at a worker’s compassion – but again, we have to deliver that help within professional boundaries.
o	Socioeconomic Challenges: Emphasize the high poverty and low income levels. For instance, “Clare County has one of the lowest median household incomes in Michigan at about $37,000 – that’s roughly $18k less than the state median”[19]. Many families struggle financially: nearly half of Clare’s residents (49%) live below 200% of the federal poverty level[3]. Other counties are similar: Gladwin ~43%[20], Roscommon ~43%[4], Osceola ~43%[21], Isabella ~45% (partly due to low-income students)[22]. Even the “wealthier” counties in our district have around 18–19% of people below the poverty line (e.g. Arenac, Gladwin)[23][24].
o	What this means: Clients may lack basic resources – transportation, phones, childcare, etc. – and thus lean on our staff for extra help or emotional support. It might feel natural to want to “bend the rules” to help a struggling client (for example, drive them to an appointment because they have no car). But given our policy, we must find other ways to help (like connecting them to a transportation program) without crossing professional lines. We’ll soon discuss how to do that.
o	Boundary Decision Path: Recognize → Empathize → Cite role/policy → Offer in‑scope alternatives/referrals → Document → Consult supervisor when in doubt.
o	Healthcare Access & Boundaries Impact: Stress that these counties have limited healthcare services, increasing pressure on health department staff. Show a few striking stats:
o	Provider shortages: “In some of our counties, residents have very few healthcare providers.” For example, Gladwin County has no OB/GYN physicians practicing in-county (0 OB/GYN FTE) and essentially no local psychiatrists[25]. Osceola County, similarly, has 0 OB/GYNs and 0 psychiatrists – meaning clients must go out of county for those services[26]. Even primary care is scarce: Osceola has about 1 primary care provider per 5,600 residents (state average is 1 per 766)[27], and dentist access can be as bad as 1 dentist per ~11,600 residents in Osceola[8].
o	Implication: Many clients rely on the health department as a safety net. For example, a public health nurse might be the most readily available healthcare person a family knows. Thus, clients might ask our staff for advice or services beyond our programs (seeing us as a “go-to” for all health needs). Staff may feel pressure to fill gaps that the community has – but we must still stick to our roles and refer out appropriately. This is tough, so it’s important we talk through it (which we will in our scenarios).
o	Close-knit communities: Acknowledge that because these are small communities, professional and personal worlds easily mix. It’s common that a client you serve is also “your kid’s schoolteacher” or your cousin’s neighbor, etc. That can make setting boundaries awkward – people might assume on personal terms (“Hey, we’re neighbors, can you just look at this rash real quick?” or “We’re friends from church, so I added you on Facebook”). We remind everyone: the policy applies even in small-town settings – friendly familiarity can’t override professional rules. We’ll discuss strategies like politely but firmly saying, “I’m happy to answer your health questions – please call me at the office on Monday and I’ll schedule an appointment,” instead of engaging in personal settings.
10.	Wrap up this section by reinforcing: “These local factors – poverty, lack of services, close communities – don’t change the fundamental rules of professional boundaries, but they do mean we have to be extra mindful and sometimes creative in how we maintain boundaries. Next, we’ll practice some scenarios to see what that looks like in real life.” This creates a bridge to the interactive portion.
11.	Scenario-Based Group Discussion (15 minutes) – Interactive practice with realistic situations, focusing on adapting boundaries to local challenges.
12.	Explain the activity format: You will present a series of short scenario descriptions, each depicting a common boundary dilemma a staff member could face in our region. After each scenario, give participants a couple of minutes to think or discuss with a neighbor, then discuss together as a group. Encourage people from different counties to share input – since experiences might differ (someone from Isabella’s more urban setting might have a different perspective than someone from rural Arenac, which is great for learning).
13.	Present Scenario 1: “The Transportation Dilemma.”
o	Story: You’re a Public Health Nurse doing a home visit in Gladwin County. Your client, an expectant mother, has no car and there is no public transportation in her rural area. She has an OB appointment in the nearest city (an hour away) next week. She asks if you could drive her there, since she knows you’ll be coming by that day.
o	Ask the group: “What would you do in this situation? How can we help the client without violating our professional boundaries?”
o	Discussion Points: This hits on policy rule #2 (staying in scope) – we are not allowed to transport clients in our vehicles. We expect staff to respond that they must politely decline the request to give a ride, explaining it’s against agency rules (so the client understands it’s not personal). However, they shouldn’t just leave it at “no.” In discussion, guide them to good practices: e.g., help the client find an alternative – maybe connect her with a Medicaid transportation service, a local nonprofit that gives rides, a church volunteer driver, or see if telehealth is an option for that appointment. Emphasize empathetic communication: e.g., “I understand it’s really hard to get to your appointment. I’m sorry I can’t drive you – my job actually doesn’t allow me to transport clients – but let’s see how else we can get you there.” This way, the nurse maintains the boundary (no personal transport) and still actively helps within her role (care coordination).
o	Mention that such scenarios are very common in our rural areas, which is why it’s crucial to have plans and community resource knowledge rather than bending the rules ourselves.
o	Model phrase: “I understand it’s difficult to get there. I’m not allowed to transport clients, but I can help arrange Medicaid transport or a community ride.”
14.	Present Scenario 2: “Dual Relationship – Wearing Two Hats.”
o	Story: You work in Clare County as a Community Health Worker. You’re assigned a new client for a nutrition program, and it turns out she is actually your grandmother’s neighbor and someone you’ve chatted with at family gatherings before. She says happily, “Oh, I’m so glad it’s you! Now we can visit like friends during our appointments.”
o	Ask: “What issues do you see here, and what should you do?”
o	Discussion Points: This touches on pre-existing personal relationships and potential conflict of interest. The staff and client already know each other socially, which can blur roles. According to policy, the staff must inform their supervisor about this relationship before proceeding. Discuss why: boundaries-wise, it might be hard to stay objective if you have a personal connection. The supervisor might decide to reassign the client to avoid any perception of favoritism or discomfort. Or, if it’s deemed manageable, they might let you continue but with clear guidance (e.g., keep interactions strictly professional, perhaps even note in the file that you have a prior acquaintance).
o	Also discuss how to set expectations with the client: The client’s comment suggests she sees this as a friendship visit. The staff should gently clarify roles: “It’s nice to see a familiar face too! Just so you know, in my professional role I have to keep our visits focused on the program – I’m here as your Community Health Worker, not in a social way. I’m sure you understand we have to keep it professional.” It might feel awkward but it’s important. If the client continues to blur lines (wanting longer chats unrelated to the service, or asking personal favors because “we’re friends”), the staff will need to reinforce boundaries or involve the supervisor again.
o	Remind participants that in small towns, this happens a lot – clients might be friends, relatives, former classmates. Transparency and supervisor guidance are key. And it’s okay to excuse yourself from handling a case if you feel you can’t separate the personal relationship – that’s often the best for both parties.
o	Model phrase: “It’s nice to see a familiar face. In my professional role, I need to keep our visits focused on your program goals. I’ll also check with my supervisor about the best plan.”
15.	Present Scenario 3: “Social Media Request.”
o	Story: An Isabella County health educator runs a teen parenting support group. After one session, a 19-year-old client in the group sends the educator a Facebook friend request and also a direct message saying, “Thanks for all your help, I’d love to stay in touch and maybe grab coffee sometime.”
o	Ask: “How should the staff member respond to the friend request or the invitation? What boundary issues are at stake?”
o	Discussion Points: This scenario spotlights social media and personal invitation boundaries. As the policy states, staff should not friend or follow current clients on social networking sites. The correct action is to not accept the friend request. In the group discussion, confirm everyone understands that rule. Then discuss how to communicate that boundary to the client in a professional way. For example, the educator can reply to the message in a polite, professional tone via official channels (if a reply is needed): “I’m glad you found the group helpful! I make sure to keep my work and personal life separate, so I don’t connect with clients on social media or outside of group meetings. However, I’m always here for you through the program – feel free to call or email me at the office anytime you need support or resources.” This kind of response thanks the client for their appreciation but clearly sets the boundary that the relationship stays within the professional context of the program.
o	Also, address the coffee invitation: one-on-one socializing would be inappropriate because it blurs professional lines into friendship/possibly dual relationship. The educator should kindly decline, maybe saying they can talk more at the next scheduled group or appointment instead.
o	Bring up that younger clients (like teens or young adults) may see these boundaries differently or be more likely to reach out on social platforms. It’s our job to hold the line consistently and explain why if needed (“agency rules,” “protect your privacy,” etc.).
o	If anyone in the group has faced this, invite them (briefly) to share how they handled it. It normalizes that it’s a common situation and something we can prepare for.
o	Model phrase: “I’m glad the group helped. I keep work and personal life separate, so I don’t connect with clients on social media. You can always reach me through the office.”
16.	Present Scenario 4: “Community Encounters and Confidentiality.”
o	Story: In Arenac County, you (an outreach worker) are off duty and attending a local community barbecue. You see one of your clients there. Before you decide how to approach, the client waves you over to meet her family and starts talking about how you’ve been helping her with a sensitive health issue, in front of everyone.
o	Ask: “What are the boundary and privacy considerations here? How would you handle this surprise situation?”
o	Discussion Points: This scenario deals with public boundaries and confidentiality. Key points to discuss:
o	Even though you’re off duty, you’re still obligated to protect the client’s privacy. If a client discloses their own health info publicly, that’s their choice, but you should not reciprocate by discussing their case in front of others. You also shouldn’t confirm or add details that the client hasn’t shared.
o	A good approach is to be friendly but steer the conversation away from private details. For example, graciously greet the family but say something like, “It’s great to see you! Let’s catch up about that privately another time. How are you enjoying the barbecue?” – shifting focus to the event. If the client keeps talking about it, you might politely remind them, “I’d love to talk more about how things are going, but I want to respect your privacy – let’s chat during our next appointment, where it’s confidential.” This way you’re signaling care but also maintaining a professional stance about confidentiality.
o	Highlight that in small communities, these chance meetings are likely. The policy doesn’t spell out this exact scenario, but its spirit (confidentiality, professionalism) guides us. We should neither ignore the client (which could seem rude or make them feel bad) nor dive into a case discussion in public.
o	Also, never reveal to others that the person is your client. If someone else at the event asks “How do you two know each other?”, you can say something generic like “Oh, we’ve worked together” without elaborating. Protecting client confidentiality and dignity is a priority, even in casual settings.
o	After discussing, summarize: encountering clients in the community requires quick judgment – be friendly, maintain professional decorum, and protect privacy. It might help to plan ahead; many of our staff live in the communities they serve, so it’s wise to think about how you’ll handle it when you inevitably bump into clients at the store, school, church, etc.
o	Model phrase: “Great to see you! Let’s talk about your health privately at our next appointment so I can respect your confidentiality.”
17.	Facilitate group input: After each scenario, affirm correct interpretations and gently correct any suggestions that would violate policy. Use the policy language to back up answers: e.g., “Right, giving a ride feels helpful but remember the policy explicitly prohibits staff from transporting clients in their vehicles, so we can’t do that.” or “Yes, adding a client on Facebook might seem supportive, but policy says social media contact is off-limits.” This helps reinforce that the policy is our guide even in these nuanced situations.
18.	Bridge to next section: Thank participants for their ideas and insights, noting how much practical knowledge is in the room. Transition by saying, “We’ve identified some great ways to handle these situations. Next, let’s distill some general strategies you can use to adapt your professional boundaries to our local needs.”
19.	Adapting Professional Boundaries – Strategies for Local Factors (15 minutes) – Consolidate best practices and provide guidance on handling boundary issues given the local context. This section is more of a mini-lecture with discussion, summarizing what was learned and adding new tips.
20.	Proactive Communication: Emphasize the importance of setting boundaries early with clients to preempt many issues. Reiterate the policy’s first step: “Staff will set clear expectations for clients at the start of services…”. Encourage staff to incorporate a brief “introduction statement” in their first meeting that covers boundaries. For example, “I’m here as your nurse, and I’ll be visiting you once a week to work on X. Just so it’s clear, I can’t do certain things like drive clients places or handle issues outside my role, but I’ll always try to connect you with help if you need it.” This may feel a bit formal, but it protects against future misunderstandings and gives the client a clear picture of what your relationship will look like. Role-model phrasing that is respectful yet firm about boundaries.
21.	Empathy with Clarity: Discuss how to respond when clients push boundaries due to local hardships. The goal is to show empathy for their situation while still saying “no” or drawing the line. For instance, if a client asks for something outside your role (like money, a ride, or personal advice), you might respond, “I really wish I could do that for you because I see you need it; however, I’m not allowed to [give clients rides/lend money/etc.]. What I can do is help you find another solution…”. This approach acknowledges the valid need (so the client feels heard and respected) but clearly cites the boundary (“not allowed to”). Then pivot to problem-solving within your role – such as referring them to an appropriate agency, helping fill out paperwork, or brainstorming other resources (consistent with “will refer clients out as needed”). By doing this, staff can maintain a caring relationship without personally overstepping. We reinforce that kindness doesn’t require breaking rules – it requires creativity and resourcefulness within the rules.
22.	Use Supervisors and Team Support: Strongly remind staff that they are not alone in dealing with tricky boundary situations. The policy explicitly says to consult a supervisor if any boundary questions or personal relationships arise. Encourage a culture where staff feel comfortable bringing up dilemmas (“I’m worried I’m getting too involved with this client” or “My client keeps calling me after hours, what do I do?”). Supervisors can provide guidance, help set additional boundaries (like changing a client’s appointment or having two staff attend a visit if needed), or reassign cases if necessary. Sometimes just talking it out with a colleague or supervisor can prevent a boundary slip. Emphasize: Asking for help or saying “I’m not comfortable, I think my boundaries are getting crossed” is a sign of professionalism, not a failure. It shows you take the ethics seriously.
23.	Self-Care and Self-Awareness: Stress that working in these high-need communities can tug at one’s heartstrings. It’s easy to either over-involve oneself (trying to “save” clients by doing too much) or in some cases under-involve (burning out or becoming jaded and then withdrawing). Both extremes are risky. The policy even notes staff should be careful if they sense they are becoming “over- or under-involved with clients or others involved in their care” – that’s a red flag. Teach staff to recognize signs of boundary strain in themselves: e.g., are you constantly worrying about a client at home? Are you considering breaking a rule “just this once” because you feel so bad for them? Do you dread seeing a client because you've become too emotionally drained? These could indicate boundary issues or compassion fatigue. Suggest strategies like debriefing tough cases with a peer or supervisor, taking regular breaks/vacation to recharge, and reminding oneself of one’s role scope to avoid boundary creep. Healthy boundaries actually help prevent burnout – you cannot personally fix all of a client’s problems, you can only do your professional part.
24.	Leveraging Local Resources: Provide a quick list or handout of local resources in each county (e.g., transport services, food banks, senior services, support groups, tribal services in Isabella/Arenac, etc.). Encourage staff to familiarize themselves with these. That way, when a client asks for something beyond your role, you have a referral at your fingertips. For example, “I can’t drive you, but here’s a free transportation hotline we have in our county[28][29]” (if such exists) or “I’m not allowed to accept gifts, but if you’d like to give back, our department always appreciates volunteer help at events – I can connect you with that team.” Knowing the community network allows staff to maintain boundaries while still connecting clients to help. It flips situations from personal asks to professional referrals.
25.	Consistent Enforcement: Encourage staff to be consistent and fair with boundaries. In small communities, word gets around. If you bend a rule for one client (even with good intentions), others will hear about it (“Oh, Worker X gave so-and-so a ride, maybe I can ask for one too”). This can spiral and undermine the overall professionalism of services. It’s actually kinder in the long run to apply the rules uniformly – no favorites, no special cases – so no client feels unfairly treated. If an exceptional situation truly warrants making an exception, that’s a decision for leadership, not individual staff on the fly. So day-to-day, stick to the established boundaries for everyone. This also protects the staff from accusations of bias or improper behavior.
26.	Cultural Sensitivity: Touch on adapting boundaries with cultural respect, especially if any populations (like Native American communities in our region, or particular religious communities) have different norms for interaction. For example, some cultures might insist on offering you food or a gift as a sign of respect. Refusing could be seen as rude. How to handle that? Suggest: graciously accept a small token if refusing would damage rapport (the policy does allow nominal gifts[9]), but always clarify you’re doing so within what’s permitted and perhaps share it with the team. Or find a polite middle ground (e.g., taste a bit of the dish to honor the gesture, but don’t take gifts home). The key is to uphold the spirit of the boundary (not allowing a gift to influence you or turn into a regular expectation) while navigating cultural kindness. Encourage staff to discuss such situations with supervisors if unsure.
27.	Summarize Strategies: Perhaps list on a slide: “How to Adapt Boundaries in Our Communities: 1) Communicate early and clearly; 2) Be empathetic but firm when saying no; 3) Offer alternatives within your role; 4) Consult supervisors for any grey areas; 5) Take care of your own emotional boundaries; 6) Know your local resources; 7) Be fair and consistent with all clients.” We have essentially covered these, tying them back to both policy points and the local context discussed.
28.	Invite any input: “Does anyone have additional tips that have worked for you in maintaining boundaries here? Maybe something specific to your county?” This lets experienced staff share wisdom (e.g., someone might say “I’ve learned to tell clients upfront that I can’t friend them on Facebook, so they don’t take it personally later.”) Acknowledge useful contributions and incorporate them into the collective advice.
29.	Conclusion and Q&A (Approx. 5 minutes) – Wrap up the training and address final questions.
30.	Recap Key Takeaways: Reiterate in one or two sentences the core message: “Maintaining professional boundaries is not just a bureaucratic requirement – it’s how we ensure ethical, respectful, and effective care. Especially in our six counties, where we face unique challenges like poverty, provider shortages, and overlapping personal networks, strong boundaries are what allow us to help people in the long run without confusion or conflict. They build trust by defining our professional relationships clearly.” Remind them that the CMDHD policy exists to back them up in these situations – it gives us a consistent framework to operate within. By following it, staff protect clients’ interests and their own. As the policy states, all staff must follow these procedures to maintain professional boundaries with clients – it’s an expectation of our employment and crucial for our mission of service.
31.	Emphasize Support: Let staff know that if they’re ever unsure about a boundary in practice, they should feel empowered to pause and seek guidance (better to check first than cross a line). The administration and supervisors are there to support them in upholding these standards. We’d rather someone ask, “Is it okay if I do XYZ for a client?” than inadvertently violate a rule. Reinforce that any breach of professional boundaries can have consequences (for the client’s well-being and the staff’s job)[30], so it’s always worth double-checking.
32.	Acknowledge the Difficulty: It’s worth acknowledging that this can be hard: “We know it’s not always easy to say no or keep that professional distance, especially when you care deeply about helping people. But remember, kindness and professionalism go hand in hand – you can be very compassionate and helpful within clear boundaries. In fact, clients ultimately benefit from a relationship that’s consistent and focused on their needs rather than our personal involvement.” Sometimes a client might test or even complain about a boundary (“that nurse wouldn’t even add me on Facebook, she must not care”) – but usually, with good communication, clients understand that you are doing your job the right way. And that consistency reassures them that they’re in good hands.
33.	Final Q&A: Open the floor for any questions or even last comments. Possible questions might be like, “What if a client insists on giving me a gift card?” or “How do I handle a client who keeps calling me by my nickname and acting overly friendly?” Answer them by referencing the policy and strategies discussed: in those examples, politely enforce the gift rule[9], and model professional but warm interaction to subtly reset the tone. If time is short, encourage those with complex questions to follow up after the session or with their supervisor, but ensure everyone feels heard.
34.	Close with Encouragement: End on a positive and empowering note. For instance: “Thank you all for your participation and the work you do in our communities. Upholding professional boundaries might sometimes feel like a tightrope walk, but with the principles we discussed – and with each other’s support – you can navigate any tricky situation that comes your way. Remember, when in doubt, lean on the policy and your team. Let’s continue to provide great service across Arenac, Clare, Gladwin, Isabella, Osceola, and Roscommon counties, while keeping those professional boundaries strong. You’ve got this!”
35.	Follow-up Resources: Mention that we will email a one-page cheat sheet summarizing the key boundary rules and tips for quick reference, and include contact info for who to reach out to (perhaps the training coordinator or HR) if they have questions or encounter a boundary issue down the line. Also, attach the full Professional Boundaries Policy document (or let them know where to find it on the intranet) for their reference[31]. This way, the learning extends beyond the training room.
Throughout this step-by-step delivery, we balance information and interaction, ensuring the session is comprehensive but not just a lecture. By using local data and scenarios, we keep the training grounded in the everyday reality of our six counties, which should make it more impactful. Participants will leave with both quantitative insights (how prevalent certain issues are, underscoring why boundaries are needed) and qualitative strategies (practical communication techniques and scenario practice) for maintaining professional boundaries. This scaffolded approach – from policy to context to practice – thoroughly prepares staff to uphold the high standards of professional conduct expected by CMDHD, no matter which county they serve.

The Population Health Institute puts out data each year about two years past so the data linked below for each county is from 2023. But this will give some insight into the needs in our community. Big Highlights- Large percentages of Medicaid clients, all rural by definition (and many more rural than my area), almost all are in the lower 60% of health statistics for various reasons, and very low providers. <https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/health-data/michigan/arenac?year=2025> <https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/health-data/michigan/clare?year=2025> <https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/health-data/michigan/gladwin?year=2025> <https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/health-data/michigan/isabella?year=2025> <https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/health-data/michigan/osceola?year=2025> <https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/health-data/michigan/roscommon?year=2025>
