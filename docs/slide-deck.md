## Six-County Context: Factors That Test Boundaries (8 min)

- Rural character; frequent community overlap
- Older populations; higher disability prevalence
- Poverty and limited transportation resources
- Provider shortages in OB/GYN, psychiatry, dental, primary care

Speaker notes:

- Call out county examples briefly; keep focus on boundary impact.

## Scenario 1: Transportation Dilemma (3 min)

- Client asks for a ride to appointment
- Script: Empathize → cite policy → offer alternatives (Medicaid transport, local orgs, telehealth)
- Document and, if needed, consult supervisor

Speaker notes:

- Roleplay the refusal + alternative script with audience volunteers.

## Scenario 2: Dual Relationship (3 min)

- Client is a neighbor/family acquaintance
- Script: Acknowledge familiarity → clarify professional role → consult supervisor; consider reassignment
- Document relationship and plan

Speaker notes:

- Ask when reassignment is appropriate vs. proceed with safeguards.

## Scenario 3: Social Media Request (3 min)

- Client sends friend request/DM
- Script: Thank → explain professional separation → offer official contact channels
- Do not accept request; keep communication professional

Speaker notes:

- Address generational expectations; reiterate official channels.

## Scenario 4: Public Encounter & Confidentiality (3 min)

- Client discusses sensitive info in public
- Script: Be cordial → redirect to privacy → schedule follow-up in confidential setting
- Avoid confirming details publicly

Speaker notes:

- Practice redirect lines; normalize friendly but professional tone.

## Micro-Framework: Boundary Decision Path (5 min)

- Recognize need/request → Empathize
- Reference policy/role → Decline boundary-crossing action
- Offer in-scope alternatives/referrals
- Document; consult supervisor when in doubt

Speaker notes:

- Highlight consistency across scenarios; fairness across clients.

## Communication Toolkit (5 min)

- Setting expectations on first contact
- Empathetic “no + alternative” phrases
- Social media refusal phrasing
- Supervisor consultation phrases

Speaker notes:

- Encourage writing a personal “first-visit boundary script.”

## Self-Check & Support (3 min)

- Signs of over/under-involvement
- Use supervision early; team debriefs
- Consistency across clients

Speaker notes:

- Name 2–3 red flags (time spent, favoritism, off-hours contacts).
