Perfect — let’s create a **comprehensive mapping** of how your **training module** works *hand-in-hand* with the **CMDHD Professional Boundaries Policy**. The idea is to show that the training is **not separate** from the policy but rather **an applied, contextualized extension** of it. This ensures participants see the **policy as the foundation** and the **training as the bridge between policy and practice**.

---

# **Comprehensive Breakdown: Training + Policy Integration**

---

## **1. Shared Purpose**

* **Policy Purpose:**
  To ensure professional conduct and maintain boundaries that “set a clear relationship between the client and staff, preventing role confusion”.
* **Training Purpose:**
  To **teach staff how to live out that purpose in real-world practice**—especially within the unique context of CMDHD’s six rural counties.
* **Integration:**
  Training reinforces the policy’s **intent** (clarity, professionalism, ethical protection) by demonstrating **why it matters locally** and how to apply it with compassion, consistency, and cultural awareness.

---

## **2. Structure of Training = Structure of Policy**

The CMDHD policy outlines **procedures 1–15**. The training mirrors and expands on each:

| **Policy Section**                 | **Policy Language (Summary)**                               | **Training Integration**                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. **Set clear expectations**      | Staff must set expectations with clients at start           | Training teaches *how* to phrase these expectations, including sample scripts, role-play practice, and why clarity reduces misunderstandings in rural communities. |
| 2. **Scope of practice**           | Work only within your role, no transport/errands            | Training uses **transportation & errands scenarios** (common in rural counties) to practice declining requests while offering alternative resources.               |
| 3. **Ethical standards**           | Follow professional codes                                   | Training highlights NASW & ANA ethics, showing alignment between CMDHD policy and broader professional standards.                                                  |
| 4. **Conflicts of interest**       | Avoid & disclose conflicts, may need reassignment           | Training provides *dual-relationship scenarios* (e.g., client is a neighbor or family friend) and practices supervisor consultation.                               |
| 5. **Pre-existing relationships**  | Must disclose to supervisor                                 | Training uses local rural examples where staff often know clients socially, and discusses strategies to manage boundaries in “everyone knows everyone” contexts.   |
| 6. **Social relationships**        | Inappropriate; no friending/liking/following clients online | Training includes **social media roleplay** (e.g., Facebook friend request) and teaches respectful refusal language.                                               |
| 7. **Over/under involvement**      | Avoid emotional entanglement or neglect                     | Training teaches **self-awareness skills**: signs of compassion fatigue, strategies for balance, and when to seek supervision.                                     |
| 8. **Personal space/touch**        | Ask for consent, only touch within scope                    | Training demonstrates **safe, respectful phrasing** for consent (e.g., “May I take your blood pressure now?”).                                                     |
| 9. **Personal info disclosure**    | Don’t share unnecessary personal details                    | Training covers *why oversharing is tempting in small communities* and how to redirect conversations.                                                              |
| 10. **Professional communication** | Use clear, respectful language                              | Training emphasizes respectful tone, avoiding jargon, and practicing difficult conversations.                                                                      |
| 11. **Respect names/pronouns**     | Use client’s preferred terms                                | Training includes *inclusive communication exercises* and modeling respectful clarification.                                                                       |
| 12. **Avoid controversial topics** | No political/religious debates                              | Training uses **case studies** (e.g., a client raises politics during a home visit) to practice redirecting without offense.                                       |
| 13. **Work hours**                 | No services outside defined hours unless pre-arranged       | Training emphasizes time boundaries and gives examples of how to politely decline after-hours requests.                                                            |
| 14. **Gifts**                      | No gifts/gratuities > $25                                   | Training includes **gift scenarios** (e.g., client offers venison, baked goods, gift cards) and scripts for polite refusal.                                        |
| 15. **Disciplinary action**        | Breaches may result in discipline                           | Training reinforces accountability and stresses supervisor consultation to prevent policy violations.                                                              |

## **3. The "Why" Layer Added by Training**

* **Policy = Rules.** Training adds **context, rationale, and application.**
* Examples:

  * **Policy says:** “No transporting clients.”
  * **Training adds:** *Why?* Liability, role confusion, and fairness across clients. *How?* Roleplay declining rides while referring clients to Medicaid transport or local nonprofit resources.
  * **Policy says:** “Avoid social relationships.”
  * **Training adds:** *Why?* In small communities, dual roles are common but can erode impartiality. *How?* Use supervisor guidance and clear professional communication to reset expectations.

---

## **4. Local Adaptation**

* **Policy applies universally** across CMDHD.
* **Training localizes it** for Arenac, Clare, Gladwin, Isabella, Osceola, Roscommon:

  * Poverty and Medicaid reliance → clients ask for favors → training emphasizes empathetic “no + referral.”
  * Small-town overlap → staff often know clients socially → training emphasizes supervisor consultation and disclosure.
  * Provider shortages → clients lean on CMDHD staff for extra needs → training emphasizes scope-of-practice clarity and referral networks.
  * Older populations → clients may view staff as surrogate family → training emphasizes professionalism with warmth but without blurred roles.

---

## **5. Mutual Reinforcement**

* **Policy without training** = staff know the rules but may struggle in nuanced situations.
* **Training without policy** = staff may feel guided by “suggestions” rather than enforceable standards.
* **Together:**

  * **Policy** gives authority and consistency.
  * **Training** builds skill, confidence, and cultural sensitivity in applying those rules.

---

## **6. First Principles Lens**

At the most fundamental level:

* **Principle 1:** Professional boundaries exist to **protect clients’ interests** and ensure fairness.
* **Principle 2:** Staff must **stay within their role** to avoid confusion, liability, or favoritism.
* **Principle 3:** In **resource-limited, rural contexts**, boundary challenges are more frequent, so staff need tools to **adapt without breaking rules**.
* **Policy codifies these principles.**
* **Training operationalizes them.**

---

✅ **Bottom line:**
Your training module is the **living application of the CMDHD policy**. It takes the black-and-white rules of the policy, adds the **why**, contextualizes them with **county-specific realities**, and equips staff with the **how** (scripts, roleplays, strategies). This ensures staff not only comply with policy but also feel **empowered to uphold boundaries compassionately and effectively** in the real-world environments where they work.

---

Would you like me to now **draft a side-by-side training + policy “cheat sheet” handout** (1 page) that staff can keep, showing the *rule* and the *practice example*? This could reinforce the integration during and after the training.
