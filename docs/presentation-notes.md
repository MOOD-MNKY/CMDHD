## Research Synthesis (Foundations)

NASW 1.06 (Conflicts of Interest)
- Avoid conflicts that impair impartial judgment; disclose real/potential conflicts to clients; resolve with clients’ interests primary (may require termination/referral). Avoid dual/multiple relationships that risk exploitation or harm; avoid social networking relationships that cause boundary confusion.
- Mapping: CMDHD Procedures 4–5 (conflicts/dual) and 6 (no social relationships/social media) directly align.

ANA Professional Boundaries (Provisions 2.x)
- Relationships are therapeutic; maintain appropriate limits; same ethics online and offline; protect privacy and confidentiality; treat gifts with caution; maintain professionalism in social media.
- Mapping: CMDHD 6 (social media), 8 (consent/touch), 10–11 (professional language/names), 14 (gifts).

NCSBN Professional Boundaries
- Boundaries are the space between nurse’s power and patient’s vulnerability; continuum from under‑involvement to over‑involvement. Evaluate boundary crossings; avoid repeated crossings; examples of violations include excessive personal disclosure, secrecy, role reversal. Social media can trigger boundary violations.
- Mapping: CMDHD 7 (over/under involvement), 6 (social media), Decision Path emphasis on early consultation.

Implications for Training
- Emphasize fairness/consistency across clients; early expectation setting; document neutrally; consult supervisor early when risks arise; no friending/following current clients; scripts must pair empathy with clear boundary and an alternative.

## County Context Pointers (quick presenter list)

- Arenac: seniors ~24%; rural; CHR 2025 page; PCNA Rank 5.
- Clare: PCP ratio high; OB/GYN FTE 0; psychiatrist scarce; PCNA Rank 2.
- Gladwin: late/no prenatal care high; heart disease mortality elevated; PCNA Rank 4.
- Isabella: younger (students); fluoridated water ~37%; PCP ~1,700:1; Rank 48.
- Osceola: PCP ~5,600:1; dentist ~11,600:1 (context); Rank 9.
- Roscommon: seniors ~31%; disability ~26%; PCP ~3,700:1; Rank 6.

Usage: Pair each scenario with 1–2 county metrics to ground the discussion, then walk the Decision Path.

## Script Library (ready-to-use)

Transportation (scope)
- “I understand getting there is hard. I’m not allowed to transport clients, but I can help set up Medicaid transport or a community ride.”

Dual relationship (conflict disclosure)
- “It’s good to see a familiar face. In my professional role, I need to keep our visits focused on your goals. I’ll check with my supervisor about the best plan.”

Social media (no friending)
- “I’m glad the group helped. I keep work and personal life separate, so I don’t connect with clients on social media. You can always reach me through the office.”

Public encounter (confidentiality)
- “Great to see you! Let’s talk about your health privately at our next appointment so I can respect your confidentiality.”

Gifts (≤ $25 nominal and fairness)
- “Thank you so much for the thought. Our policy limits accepting gifts. A note to the team would mean a lot.”

## Supervisor Escalation Checklist

1) Identify boundary risk and your response (date/time)
2) Document neutrally; note alternatives offered
3) Notify supervisor within 24 hours; propose reassignment if dual relationship exists
4) Apply plan; update documentation and client communication
5) If pressure persists, consider two‑staff visits or schedule changes; escalate per policy
