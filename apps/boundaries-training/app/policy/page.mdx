## Purpose

To ensure professional conduct of staff in maintaining professional boundaries when providing services to clients. Professional boundaries are expectations that set a clear relationship between the client and staff, preventing role confusion.

## Policy

All staff will follow procedures to ensure that professional boundaries are maintained between staff and the client(s).

## Procedures

1. Staff will set clear expectations for clients at the start of services, giving clients an understanding of what is expected of them and what the client can expect from the staff.

2. Staff will work only within their scope of practice for their defined role and will refer clients out as needed.
   - This includes, but is not limited to, transporting clients in a vehicle, running errands for clients, and providing any other services not within staff scope of practice.

3. Staff shall comply with the ethical standards set forth by their professional organizations, associations and/or other recognized standards within CMDHD.

4. Staff should be alert to and avoid conflicts of interest that interfere with the exercise of professional discretion and impartial judgment. Staff should inform clients when a real or potential conflict of interest arises and take reasonable steps to resolve the issue in a manner that makes the clients' interests primary and protects clients' interests to the greatest extent possible. In some cases, protecting clients' interests may require termination of the professional relationship with proper referral of the client to another staff member or agency.<sup>[1]</sup>

5. Staff will discuss with their supervisor if a pre-existing personal or social relationship exists with a client to determine steps in moving forward. If any changes in relationship arise this must also be discussed with a supervisor.
   - This includes but is not limited to friendship, guardianship, romantic, or business relationships.

6. Social relationships between staff and their clients or families are inappropriate. Contact via social networking sites is prohibited. Staff shall assess the implications of "friending," "liking," "following," or accepting such a request from another person when there is the potential for misinterpretation of the relationship or the potential of sharing protected information that should not be shared. For example, relationships such as supervisor-subordinate and staff-staff merit close consideration of the implications and the nature of the social interaction. Employees may not knowingly friend an individual currently receiving services from CMDHD without first discussing the relationship and potential implications with their supervisor. This also applies to client caregivers, guardians, and family members.

7. Staff will pay careful attention when they are at risk of deviating from the professional relationship by becoming over- or under-involved with clients or others involved in their care.<sup>[2]</sup>

8. Respect personal space. If you perceive that touch is needed, ask for consent.
   - Do not initiate touch unless clearly asked by the family or after asking permission. (e.g. asking a parent if you can pick up a baby, or a parent requesting that you hold a child).
   - Physical contact with clients should be limited to the scope of practice (e.g. putting a baby on the scale or taking a client's blood pressure), and the client should be asked for permission before physical contact occurs.

9. Staff will not disclose any unnecessary personal information to clients.

10. Staff are expected to communicate with clients using clear, respectful and professional language at all times.

11. Staff must consistently use the client's preferred name, pronouns, and relationship terms both in conversation and in documentation. If uncertain, staff should politely ask for clarification.

12. Staff will avoid discussing controversial topics with clients, such as religious or political views.

13. Staff will not conduct services outside of defined work hours, unless pre-arranged with a supervisor.

14. The CMDHD prohibits all employees, interns, and volunteers from accepting gifts, gratuities, or entertainment from individuals and firms with whom the CMDHD does business. It is also a violation to give gifts to individuals or firms with whom the agency does business. Excluded from this prohibition is the exchange of normal business courtesies such as luncheons or dinners, when they are proper and consistent with regular business practice. Also excluded are advertising or promotional materials and holiday or other gifts, which are of nominal value (less than $25.00).

15. Staff shall discuss potential conflict of interest issues with their supervisor. Any breach of professional boundaries may result in disciplinary action.
